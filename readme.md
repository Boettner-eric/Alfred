# Alfred

I have been an Alfred power user for the last few years and I use these workflows almost everyday. In an effort to reorganize and refactor I have decided to open source my workflows and create git managed releases for easy installation and updates. If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to open an issue or pull request.

## Workflows

- [Audio Source Switcher](./audio-source/) - switch between audio IO devices
- [Calendar](./meetings-calendar/) - view upcoming events and join meetings from Alfred
- [Gitlab](./gitlab/) - view MRs, user profiles and repos in your org's gitlab instance
- [Bookmarks](./bookmarks/) - jump to webpages quickly
- Slack Status (coming soon) - change your slack status from Alfred

## External Repos
I also use a few other alfred workflows that I have modified or downloaded from alfred's workflow gallery

- [Alfred Theme Switcher (Fork)](https://github.com/Boettner-eric/alfred-theme-switcher)
- [Airpods connector](https://github.com/mariuskiessling/alfred-airpods-connector)
- [Bluetooth battery](https://alfred.app/workflows/zeitlings/bluetooth-device-battery/)
