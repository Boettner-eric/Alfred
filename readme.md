# Alfred

I have used Alfred quite a bit in the last few years and this repo contains most of the helpful workflows I have created.

## Workflows

- [Audio Source Switcher](./user.workflow.audio-source/readme.md) - switch between audio IO devices
- Calendar (coming soon) - view upcoming events and join meetings from Alfred
- Slack Status (coming soon) - change your slack status from Alfred
