# Alfred

I have been an Alfred power user for the last few years and I use these workflows almost everyday. In an effort to reorganize and refactor I have decided to open source my workflows and create git managed releases for easy installation and updates. If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to open an issue or pull request.

## Workflows

- [Audio Source Switcher](./audio-source/readme.md) - switch between audio IO devices
- Calendar (coming soon) - view upcoming events and join meetings from Alfred
- Slack Status (coming soon) - change your slack status from Alfred
